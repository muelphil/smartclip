# Getting Started

After the Installation, Smartclip will either get started by the installer or you can start it manually. Notice that Smartclip starts in the background. On first startup, Smartclip might take a while to boot, as it is indexing the applications on your computer. This may take up to a couple of minutes.

To open Smartclip you can either right-click the Icon in the Taskbar and choose `Show` or you can use the predefined keymaps to open specific Plugins directly:
- `Super` + `Space`: Start Plugin
- `Super` + `V`: Clipboard Plugin
- `Super` + `.`: Emoji Picker Plugin
- `Ctr` + `Shift` + `L`: Language Plugin

Smartclip is an extensible Launcher that consists of a prompt or search input at the top and a plugin view at the bottom, that is occupied by the currently activated plugin. You can see which plugin is currently activated on the very left of the search bar. To go back to the default plugin (currently set to the clipboard manager), you can simply press return while the caret is at the very front. To navigate to different plugins from the default plugin, simply type in the ID of the desired plugin followed by a `Space`. The following plugins are currently available:

- `clip`: Clipboard Manager (default plugin)
- `tl`: Translation Plugin
- `start`: Application Launcher/ File Explorer
- `emoji`: Emoji Picker
- `math`: Math Expressions
- `rm`: Reminder Plugin
- `settings`: Settings (can also be accessed by pressing the screw icon)

To get more information about the Plugins and how to use them, browse the designated Plugin Documentation.

You can hide Smartclip by pressing `Escape`.
