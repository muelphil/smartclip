# Plugins

Smartclip is an extensible Launcher that consists of a prompt or search input at the top and a plugin view at the bottom, that is occupied by the currently activated plugin. You can see which plugin is currently activated on the very left of the search bar. To go back to the default plugin (currently set to the clipboard manager), you can simply press return while the caret is at the very front. To navigate to different plugins from the default plugin, simply type in the ID of the desired plugin followed by a `Space`. The following plugins are currently available:

- `clip`: Clipboard Manager (default plugin)
- `tl`: Translation Plugin
- `start`: Application Launcher/ File Explorer
- `emoji`: Emoji Picker
- `math`: Math Expressions
- `rm`: Reminder Plugin
