# Plugins

Smartclip is an extensible Launcher that consists of a prompt or search input at the top and a plugin view at the bottom, that is occupied by the currently activated plugin. You
can see which plugin is currently activated on the very left of the search bar.

## Access and Explore Plugins

Open the Plugin Overview by pressing the plugin icon at the front of the searchbar (visible while the Clipboard Manager is active) or by typing plugins in the search bar.

This lists all installed plugins along with their hotkeys and IDs. You can click on a plugin to activate it. Alternatively, to navigate to different plugins from the default
plugin, simply type in the ID of the desired plugin followed by a `Space`.

Click on the currently open plugin at the front of the searchbar to return to the default plugin. Alternatively, press Backspace when the cursor is at the start of the search bar.
