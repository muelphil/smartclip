## Keyboard Shortcuts
You can quickly access the Clipboard Manager by pressing `Super` + `V` by default. You can adjust this hotkey in the Settings.

Access the context menu by pressing `Shift`+`Enter` clicking the three dots, or right-clicking on the entries. The menu provides different actions based on the type of clipboard entry.

Press `Alt` along with the numbers `1-9` to paste a specific entry. Indicators will appear while you hold `Alt`.
