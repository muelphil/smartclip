In the Installed Plugins section, youâ€™ll find the IDs for each plugin in the upper right corner.

For actions, you can choose between `Open Plugin` (this simply opens the desired plugin) and `Open current selection in Plugin`, which will copy the current selection in any other app and load it into the search bar of Smartclip.

To input hotkeys that are currently bound to system functions and would close Smartclip, simply just input the desired key without modifies like `Ctrl` or `Super` and activate the modifiers by clicking them. After that, you can submit the hotkey.

## Linux
