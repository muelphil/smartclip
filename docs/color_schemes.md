# Color Schemes

## Generator
To create custom color schemes for Smartclip, visit the [Smartclip Color Scheme Generator](https://muelphil.github.io/smartclip-color-scheme-generator/).

The generator allows you to explore and modify existing color schemes or design a completely new one.

### Features
- **Customize Colors**: Set individual colors for the background, primary, and text. Matching shades are generated automatically.
- **Randomization**: Try your luck with the **Random** button to generate random colors for the background, primary, or text.
- **Use AI for Themes**:
    - Select a theme you like and copy its CSS variables.
    - Provide these variables to ChatGPT along with your desired modifications or colors.
    - Paste the AI-generated result back into the generator to preview the outcome.

### Saving and Using Your Theme
- **Name Your Theme**: Always assign a name to your theme for easy identification.

#### Apply Your Theme directly in Smartclip

Click **Open in Smartclip** to directly load the theme into Smartclip. Ensure Smartclip is installed and running before using this feature. The theme will be saved as a user scheme.

#### Manually Download Your Theme
  - Save the theme as a `.css` file.
  - Place the downloaded file in the `.smartclip/color-schemes` directory. (The `.smartclip` folder is typically located in your home directory.)
  - Restart Smartclip to find the new theme in the settings.

### Naming Guidelines
If you rename your theme after downloading, ensure the name uses **kebab-case** (e.g., `coral-teal.css`) for compatibility.

With these tools, you can easily create and manage personalized themes for Smartclip!
