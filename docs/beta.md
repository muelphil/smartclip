# Issues and Feature Requests

Smartclip is currently in beta until at least 31/12/2024. The preview is available via [Releases](https://github.com/muelphil/smartclip/releases/new). Version 0.9.0 will be valid until 31/12/2024, I will extend the duration based on the feedback.

Smartclip is currently only available for Linux (with restrictions, see Installation section Linux) and Window, but there is a Mac version planned.

I greatly appreciate any kind of feedback, feature requests, and bug reports. To do so, please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/muelphil/smartclip/issues).
