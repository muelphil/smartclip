# Settings

Access and adjust Smartclipâ€™s behavior and appearance here. Settings are organized by plugin to help you customize the application to your preferences.

Similar to the plugins, you can open the settings by typing `settings` followed by a `Space` while in the default plugin, or alternatively press the little wheel icon on the right side of the search bar.

Settings that appear greyed out can only be modified directly in the `settings.json` file. You can open this file using the button provided in the settings. Changes made here will take effect the next time you start the application.
